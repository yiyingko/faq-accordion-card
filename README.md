This project is a solution to the **FAQ Accordion Card** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It was built as part of my earlier front-end learning journey and is kept here for reference rather than as a “perfect” example.

## Overview

Users can:
- Click a question to expand/collapse the answer
- Toggle between items (opening one closes the others)

This project focuses on DOM events + simple UI state handling.

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (event listeners + class toggling)

No frameworks or build tools were used.

---

## What I Practiced

- Structuring a simple accordion layout
- Styling a card UI
- Using `querySelectorAll` and event listeners
- Toggling classes for open/closed states

---

## Notes (Tidy-up)

This repo includes a light tidy-up:
- Added clearer, BEM-style class names **without removing the original class names**
- This keeps the original CSS/JS behaviour intact while making the markup easier to read
